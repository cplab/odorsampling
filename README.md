# Odor Sampling (`odorsampling`)
Model of physicochemical odor sampling by animal olfactory systems

# Usage

## Installation

### Manual installation
1. [Clone the repository](https://github.com/cplab/odorsampling)
2. At the top folder structure (there should be a folder named `odorsampling` with a file named `layers.py` in it.), run the following command:
```sh
python -m odorsampling -h
```
This should print out a list of commands and arguments that can be configured.

### Linux users:
- You must install tkinter to display the graphs (if it isn't already installed). It will still run without it-
  however the only way to view the graphs would be through the generated PDFs.
- Run `sudo apt-get install python-tk` if you see an error that says something like "`Unable to load matplotlib backend [mpl_backend_name]. Please ensure any required packages are installed to use this backend.`"
